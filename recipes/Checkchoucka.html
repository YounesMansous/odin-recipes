        <li>1 can (14 ounces) diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, for heat)</li>

        <li>Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)</li>
        <li>Crusty bread (for serving)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet or frying pan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped onion and minced garlic to the pan. Saut√© until the onion becomes translucent and the garlic is fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the diced bell pepper to the pan and cook for a few minutes until it begins to soften.</li>
        <li>Stir in the diced tomatoes and tomato paste. Mix well to combine.</li>
        <li>Season the mixture with ground cumin, paprika, cayenne pepper (if desired), salt, and pepper. Adjust the spices according to your taste preferences.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low and let the mixture simmer for about 10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li>Make small wells in the sauce and crack the eggs into each well. Cover the pan and let the eggs cook to your desired level of doneness. If you prefer runny yolks, cook for about 3-4 minutes. For fully cooked yolks, cook for 5-6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once the eggs are cooked to your liking, remove the pan from heat.</li>
        <li>Garnish the Checkchoucka with freshly chopped parsley.</li>
        <li>Serve the Checkchoucka hot with crusty bread for dipping and soaking up the delicious sauce.</li>
