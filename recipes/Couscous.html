    <h2>Ingredients :</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>11/2 cups couscous</li>
        <li>11/2 cups vegetable or chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt (or to taste)</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh mint</li>
        <li>1/2 cup toasted pine nuts (optional)</li>
        <li>Lemon wedges, for serving (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, bring the vegetable or chicken broth to a boil. Remove from heat and stir in the couscous. Cover the saucepan and let it sit for about 5 minutes or until the couscous has absorbed the liquid.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until it becomes translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the minced garlic, ground cumin, ground coriander, paprika, salt, and black pepper. Cook for an additional minute, stirring constantly to toast the spices.</li>
        <li>Fluff the cooked couscous with a fork and transfer it to the skillet with the seasoned onions. Mix well to combine, ensuring the couscous is evenly coated with the spices. Cook for 2-3 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li>Remove the skillet from heat. Stir in the chopped parsley and mint. If desired, add toasted pine nuts for extra texture and flavor.</li>
        <li>Serve the couscous warm as a side dish or as a bed for roasted or grilled vegetables, meat, or fish. Squeeze fresh lemon juice over the couscous for a refreshing tang, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
