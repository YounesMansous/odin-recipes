    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with layers of pasta, meat sauce, and cheese. 
            It's a hearty and comforting meal that's perfect for feeding a crowd or enjoying as leftovers.
            The pasta sheets are layered with a flavorful meat sauce, which can include ground beef, Italian sausage, onions, and garlic, along with tomatoes and herbs. In between the layers of sauce, you'll find a creamy mixture of ricotta cheese and egg, adding richness and texture to the dish. The lasagna is then generously topped with mozzarella and Parmesan cheese, creating a deliciously gooey and golden crust when baked in the oven.
            The result is a savory and satisfying dish that's sure to please both kids and adults alike.

        <li>1 can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 can (6 ounces) tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh basil, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh oregano, chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>2 cups ricotta cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef, Italian sausage, onion, and garlic over medium heat until the meat is browned and the onion is translucent. Drain any excess fat.</li>
        <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, oregano, salt, and black pepper to the skillet. Stir well and simmer for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese and beaten egg. Mix until well blended.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place 3 lasagna noodles on top.</li>
        <li>Spread half of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, followed by a third of the meat sauce and a third of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat this layering process, ending with a layer of noodles topped with the remaining meat sauce and mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the grated Parmesan cheese over the top.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Then remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes or until the lasagna is hot and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna rest for about 10 minutes before slicing and serving. This will help it hold its shape.</li>
    </ol>
